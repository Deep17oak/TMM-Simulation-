# TMM-Simulation- Dielectric Bragg Mirror Simulator

## Overview-
This project implements a transfer-matrix model for dielectric Bragg mirrors (DBRs)—alternating quarter-wave TiO₂/SiO₂ films designed to reflect around 633 nm. By multiplying simple 2×2 matrices for each interface and layer, it computes the stack’s overall reflectance and transmittance spectra.
